MailBeez 2.5 10/09/2011 cord@mailbeez.com


In case you think MailBeez is running crazy, you can check your system
for an unsupported configuration cache.

Put mailhive_info.php in your shop root (next to mailhive.php)

Change a Setting in MailBeez, e.g. deactivate a module.

Run mailhive_info.php

If everything is green - fine, you might think about other reasons.

In case there are any orange lines, you have an unsupported
configuration cache installed, which is not updated when you made
changes in MailBeez.

Please contact me by email.
